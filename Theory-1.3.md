# Theory-1: COCOMO

- List3 (downsies): 
*  rely: required reliability
   If rely goes up from slight inconvenience to risk to human life, the effort will increase linearly
*  data: secondary memory storage requirements
   If data goes up from D/P<10 to D/P>1000, the effort will increase linearly.
*  cplx: program complexity
   If cplx goes up from easy to difficult, the effort will increase linearly.
*  ruse: software reuse
   If ruse goes up from none to across multiple, the effort will increase linearly.
*  docu: documentation requirements
   If docu goes up from "Many life-cycle needs uncovered" to "Very excessive for life-cycle needs", the effort will increase linearly.
*  time: runtime pressure
   If time goes up from 50% use of available exectuion time to 95%, the effort will increase linearly.
*  stor: main memory requirements
   If stor goes up from 50% use of available storage to 95%, the effort will increase linearly.
*  pvol: platform volatility
   If pvol goes up from "major change every 12 month and minor change every 1 month to major 2 weeks and minor 2 days", the effort will increase linearly.
