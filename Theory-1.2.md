# Theory-1: COCOMO

- List2 (uppsies):
*  acap: analyst capability
   If acap goes up from 15th percentile to 90th percentile, the effort will decrease linearly
*  pcap: programmer capability
   If pcap goes up from 15th percentile to 90th percentile, the effort will decrease linearly
*  pcon: programmer continutiy
   If goes up from 48%/year to 3%/year, the effort will decrease linearly
*  aexp: analyst experience
   If goes up from 2 months to 6 years, the effort will decrease linearly
*  pexp: programmer experience
   If goes up from 2 months to 6 years, the effort will decrease linearly
*  ltex: language and tool experience
   If goes up from 2 months to 6 years, the effort will decrease linearly
*  tool: use of tools
   If goes up from "edit, code, debug" to "strong, mature, proactive lifecycle tools, well integrated with processes, methods, reuse", the effort will decrease linearly
*  site: multiple site development
   If goes up from international to fully collocated, the effort will decrease linearly
*  sced: length of schedule 
   If goes up from "75% of nominal" to 160%, the effort will decrease linearly
