# Theory-2: Treatments (management actions)

* **improvePersonnel:** This function changes the COCOMO parameters that belong to Personnel Factors categories of effort multipliers. It sets all those effort multipliers (acap, pcap, aexp, pexp, ltex, pcon) to very high (vhigh). A management will choose to do this when they are running out of time to complete a project and they decide to hire the best possible work-force, platforms and programming language.

* **relaxSchedule:** This function increases the value of Required Development Schedule (sced) to a very high level which gives us a stretch-out of 160%. This is a sign of good management skill because an accelerated schedule (low values) tend to produce more effort in the later phases of development. A stretch-out of a schedule produces more effort in the earlier phases of development where there is more time for thorough planning, specification and validation.

* **improveTeam:** This functions increases the scaling factor Team to a very high value. This is good for management because now they have stakeholders (users, customers, developers, maintainers, others) who are consistent with their objectives and are willing to accommodate other stakeholders' objective too. The stakeholders are working as a team to achieve share vision and commitments.
