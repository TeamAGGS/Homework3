# Theory-1: COCOMO

- List1 (scale factors): 
*  Prec: have we done this before?
   If Prec goes up from thoroughly unprecedented to throughly familiar, the effort will decrease dramatically
*  Flex: development flexibility
   If Flex goes up from rigorous to general goals, the effort will increase dramatically
*  Resl: any risk resolution activities?
   If Resl goes up from little to full, the effort will increase exponentially
*  Team: team cohesion
   If Team goes up from very difficult interactions to seamless interactions, the effort will decrease dramatically
*  Pmat: process maturity
   Based on weighted average of "Yes" answers to CMM Manturity Questionnaire
